# AWS Lambda Foundations

## Intro to Serverless

- With serverless, AWS handles everything required to run and scale the app.
- Lambda is a compute service that runs your code in response to events.
- Benefits of Lambda:
  - No need for provisioning or managing servers.
  - Initiates execution of code in response to events.
  - Scales automatically.
  - Built-in monitoring and logging.
  - Integration with other AWS services.
  - Flexible permissions model.
  - Pay only for the resources you use.
  - Availability and fault tolerance built-in.
- Event-driven architecture uses observable events to initiate actions and communication between different services.
- The architecture consists of Event Producers (app, website, etc.), Event Routers (ingests events and directs it to the appropriate consumers), and Event Consumers (database, financial system, customer service, etc.).
