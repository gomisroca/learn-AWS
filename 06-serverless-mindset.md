# 🤯 Serverless Mindset

- In a normal setup, as we scale up, we will need to add more and more servers, which will increase the cost, even if the servers are idle. In serverless, we only provision the resources we need, and we pay only for the resources we use.
- In Serverless, we will manage our app and code, as well as the infrastructure, such as health checks, scaling policies, etc. AWS will handle most of the infrastructure management for us.
