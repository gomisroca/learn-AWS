# Getting Started with DevOps on AWS

## What is DevOps?

- DevOps brings together development and operations to optimize productivity and reliability.
- It is a combination of:
  - Cultural philosophies sharing end-to-end responsibility.
  - Processes developed for speed and quality.
  - Tools that align with processes and automate repeatable tasks.
- Increases agility, quality, with faster releases and lower costs.

## Problems with Traditional Development Practices

- Waterfall development projects are slow, not iterative, resistant to change and have long release cycles.
  - Requirements are rigid.
  - Dev phases are isolated.
  - Testing and security come after implementation.
- Monolithic applications are hard to update and deploy.
  - Developed and deployed as a single unit. Changes are difficult to manage.
  - Tightly coupled functionality. If too large, it becomes difficult to maintain.
  - Single development stack. Changing technlogies is difficult and costly.
